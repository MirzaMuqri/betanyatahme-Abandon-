You are allowed to use this projects for anything but keep in mind that most of my codes will be unstable/unsafe. This project has been abandon since 2018 and I have decided to release it now (27.7.2020).

Some functions might not work OR will not work at all. I advise you to only use this project for TESTING purpose only.

Requirements:
- Node.JS (Tested in v10.13.0)
- MySQL Database

This project has been used on one of my friend sites called kabatnamaku.com (I am uncertain that the site is still up or no). Feel free to read, learn and judge my old me code.
